US Insurance Coverage

Here is my latest Power BI project, diving deep into US Health Insurance Coverage.

Using the robust capabilities of Power BI, I explored a comprehensive dataset to shed light on the dynamics of health insurance coverage across the United States. ðŸŒŽ

One of the highlights was leveraging a geo map to visually depict the distribution of uninsured individuals by state, providing a clear snapshot of areas with higher concentrations of uninsured populations and potential areas for targeted interventions.

Furthermore, I utilized a line chart to compare the top 10 employer-provided health insurance coverage by state, uncovering variations in coverage levels and employer contributions across different states. This analysis offers valuable insights for policymakers and businesses alike, informing strategies to improve access to employer-sponsored healthcare. 

Lastly, I employed a bar chart to compare the top 10 marketplace health insurance coverage by state, highlighting the impact of government exchanges on bridging the coverage gap and ensuring access to healthcare for individuals without employer-based options.

Through interactive dashboards and intuitive visualizations, this project aims to drive informed decision-making and promote dialogue around enhancing healthcare accessibility and coverage nationwide.
